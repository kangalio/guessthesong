# What is this

I scraped https://guessthesong.io's frontend code and reimplemented the backend

# Credit

Big thanks to GuessTheSong's devs for this wonderful online casual multiplayer game

I was allowed to make this repository open-source:

> btw would you say it's ok if i make the github repo public which contains the downloaded .html/.js/.css from guessthesong?

> Yeah that is fine, the CSS, HTML on that site was some of the first front end coding we did though so it is not that great anyway. Maybe when you launch your site you wanna put a credit to the source ðŸ«¡
